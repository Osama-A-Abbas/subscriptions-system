===================================================================
ðŸ”¹ Requirements & Planning

 - Planned the next steps for the Django project structure and main apps.

ðŸ”¹ Initial Django Setup
 - Created the initial Django project (subscriptions_management_project). - Set up the virtual environment and basic project configuration.
 - Defined initial models for Subscriptions and Categories.

ðŸ”¹ Admin Management 
- Implemented admin panel management for Subscription and Category models (registered in Django admin).

ðŸ”¹ Accounts App & Authentication 
- Created a dedicated accounts app for user authentication. 
- Added initial registration, login, and profile templates. 
- Integrated Django's built-in authentication URLs.

ðŸ”¹ Duration-Based Subscription System 
- Replaced ending_date with duration_months/duration_years fields for more intuitive user experience. 
- Implemented virtual payment system with period-by-period payment tracking. 
- Added smart form validation and dynamic UI with JavaScript field toggling. 
- Created payment marking functionality with confirmation pages. - Updated admin interface with duration display and total cost calculations.
- Added category seeder functionality for easy data population.

ðŸ”¹ Payment Management System 
- Implemented Payment model with virtual payment creation (on-demand, not upfront). 
- Added billing periods table with payment status indicators.
- Created "Mark as Paid" functionality for individual billing periods. 
- Added automatic payment record creation for current/past due periods. 
- Implemented cost calculation methods (total cost, remaining payments).

ðŸ”¹ UI/UX Enhancements 
- Enhanced subscription forms with dynamic duration fields. 
- Added JavaScript-powered field toggling based on billing cycle. 
- Created payment confirmation templates and status indicators. 
- Updated subscription detail page with comprehensive payment tracking. 
- Added visual feedback for current, past due, and paid periods.

ðŸ”¹ Database Schema Updates 
- Modified Payment model to allow null payment_date for unpaid periods. 
- Changed is_paid default to False for new payment records. 
- Added duration fields to Subscription model. 
- Created migrations for all model changes. 
- Implemented data integrity constraints for payment tracking.

===================================================================

ðŸ”¹ Payment Reset on Schedule Change

- Decided to fully reset payments (delete all Payment rows) when schedule-affecting fields change (start_date, billing_cycle, duration_months/years).
- Implemented `Subscription.save()` detection of schedule changes with logging.
- Added `reset_payments_for_new_schedule()` to delete payments atomically.
- Removed previous reconcile-on-change behavior; we now rely on fresh schedule view after reset.

ðŸ”¹ Accurate Progress & Status

- Updated overall status and progress to count only payments within the intended schedule (exclude historical rows).
- Methods updated: `get_overall_payment_status()`, `get_paid_payments_count()`.

ðŸ”¹ Reusable UI Components

- Added `partials/badge_boolean.html` to standardize boolean badges (Enabled/Disabled, Active/Inactive).
- Added `partials/confirm_modal.html` for reusable Bootstrap confirm dialogs.
- Wired confirm modal into Edit Subscription submit (warns about deleting payments on schedule change).

ðŸ”¹ Detail/List Improvements

- Clarified row-color precedence and fixed future unpaid coloring (default, not red).
- Kept explicit confirm pages for marking paid/unpaid; corrected dynamic labels.

===================================================================

ðŸ”¹ Major Code Architecture Refactoring

- **Models Package Restructuring**: Refactored monolithic `models.py` (545 lines) into organized package structure with specialized mixins for different concerns (cost calculations, payment management, renewal logic, schedule management).

- **Service Layer Implementation**: Created comprehensive service layer with domain-specific services for payment operations, subscription lifecycle management, financial calculations, and status determination.

- **View Layer Modernization**: Converted all function-based views to Class-Based Views (CBVs) with reusable mixins for user ownership, logging, messaging, transactions, context data, and error handling.

- **Form Architecture Enhancement**: Created specialized form mixins and utilities for Bootstrap styling, category ordering, cost/duration validation, and field management with comprehensive error handling.

ðŸ”¹ Template Component System

- **Reusable Partials**: Created modular template components including form fields, checkbox fields, duration fields, form actions, subscription tables, and confirmation modals for consistent UI.

- **Template Tags**: Implemented custom template filters (`add_class`, `add_attr`) for dynamic styling and better template flexibility.

- **Component Reusability**: Extracted common UI patterns into reusable components to eliminate code duplication and ensure consistency across forms and pages.

ðŸ”¹ JavaScript Architecture & Client-Side Enhancement

- **Modular JavaScript**: Extracted inline JavaScript into organized modules (dashboard.js, subscription-forms.js, utils.js) with comprehensive error handling and robust content management.

- **Dynamic UI Management**: Implemented sophisticated content storage/restoration mechanism for dashboard panel switching without page refreshes.

- **Client-Side Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and error display mechanisms for better user experience and debugging.

ðŸ”¹ Error Handling & Logging Infrastructure

- **Custom Exception System**: Created domain-specific exception classes (SubscriptionError, PaymentError, ValidationError, BusinessLogicError, DataIntegrityError, ExternalServiceError).

- **Error Handling Decorators & Mixins**: Implemented consistent error handling across views with decorators and mixins for both function-based and class-based views.

- **Middleware Integration**: Created custom middleware for global error logging and request monitoring with comprehensive logging configuration.

- **Logging Configuration**: Set up detailed logging with multiple handlers (file, console) and formatters for different environments and debugging needs.

ðŸ”¹ Code Organization & Maintainability

- **Selectors Pattern**: Implemented read-only query helpers to separate read operations from write operations for better performance and clarity.

- **Management Commands**: Created debugging tools including `debug_billing_periods.py` for comprehensive billing period troubleshooting.

- **Settings Enhancement**: Integrated custom middleware and comprehensive logging configuration into Django settings.

ðŸ”¹ Bug Fixes & Improvements

- **Form Validation Issues**: Fixed form "freezing" problems and relaxed start date validation to allow past/future dates for better UX.

- **Dashboard Content Management**: Resolved dashboard content disappearing issue with robust content storage and restoration mechanism.

- **Payment Schedule Accuracy**: Improved current payment determination after schedule changes with enhanced date comparison logic and billing period regeneration.

- **Admin Interface**: Simplified admin interface and fixed FieldError issues with proper related name handling and field references.

ðŸ”¹ Documentation & Code Quality

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed docstrings and comments throughout the codebase for better maintainability and understanding.

- **Code Review & Analysis**: Conducted thorough code review and implemented best practices for Django development including separation of concerns, DRY principles, and clean architecture.

- **Scalability Improvements**: Designed architecture to be scalable and maintainable with clear separation between models, services, views, and templates.
