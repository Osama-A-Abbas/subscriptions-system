🔹 Duration-Based Subscription System - Replaced ending_date with duration_months/duration_years fields for more intuitive user experience. - Implemented virtual payment system with period-by-period payment tracking. - Added smart form validation and dynamic UI with JavaScript field toggling. - Created payment marking functionality with confirmation pages. - Updated admin interface with duration display and total cost calculations. - Added category seeder functionality for easy data population.

🔹 Payment Management System - Implemented Payment model with virtual payment creation (on-demand, not upfront). - Added billing periods table with payment status indicators. - Created "Mark as Paid" functionality for individual billing periods. - Added automatic payment record creation for current/past due periods. - Implemented cost calculation methods (total cost, remaining payments).

🔹 UI/UX Enhancements - Enhanced subscription forms with dynamic duration fields. - Added JavaScript-powered field toggling based on billing cycle. - Created payment confirmation templates and status indicators. - Updated subscription detail page with comprehensive payment tracking. - Added visual feedback for current, past due, and paid periods.

🔹 Database Schema Updates - Modified Payment model to allow null payment_date for unpaid periods. - Changed is_paid default to False for new payment records. - Added duration fields to Subscription model. - Created migrations for all model changes. - Implemented data integrity constraints for payment tracking.

🔹 Payment Reset on Schedule Change

- Decided to fully reset payments (delete all Payment rows) when schedule-affecting fields change (start_date, billing_cycle, duration_months/years).
- Implemented `Subscription.save()` detection of schedule changes with logging.
- Added `reset_payments_for_new_schedule()` to delete payments atomically.
- Removed previous reconcile-on-change behavior; we now rely on fresh schedule view after reset.

🔹 Accurate Progress & Status

- Updated overall status and progress to count only payments within the intended schedule (exclude historical rows).
- Methods updated: `get_overall_payment_status()`, `get_paid_payments_count()`.

🔹 Reusable UI Components

- Added `partials/badge_boolean.html` to standardize boolean badges (Enabled/Disabled, Active/Inactive).
- Added `partials/confirm_modal.html` for reusable Bootstrap confirm dialogs.
- Wired confirm modal into Edit Subscription submit (warns about deleting payments on schedule change).

🔹 Detail/List Improvements

- Clarified row-color precedence and fixed future unpaid coloring (default, not red).
- Kept explicit confirm pages for marking paid/unpaid; corrected dynamic labels.
